Boreal lakes have strong hydrological ties with lake-margin wetlands, indicating that lake shrinkage should be associated with losses in wetland area (Whitehouse and Bayley 2005). Lakes and lake-margin wetlands provide critical breeding habitat for North American waterfowl, and reductions in their abundance are projected to drive local and regional declines in waterfowl diversity (Roach and Griffith 2015). Lakes and wetlands also contain the majority of all boreal organic carbon, which repreesents one of the largest organic carbon pools in the world (Benoy et al. 2007). Although the majority of boreal C is locked away in deep, stable permafrost deposits, a significant fraction can be found in surface organic layers, which are composed of partially decomposed vegetation, or peat (Gorham 1991). The belowground C stored in peat is strongly affected by the accumulation, death, and decomposition of aboveground biomass (AGB; Chapin et al. 2009; Conti and Díaz 2013), which also functions as a source of forage and/or cover for wildlife. The rate of AGB production is parabolically related to soil moisture, while peat accumulation is driven by a combination of low temperatures and saturated, anoxic soils, which impedes decomposition (Gorham 1991; McGuire and Anderson 2009). In other words, above-ground and below-ground carbon balance in lake-margin wetlands is likely sensitive to lake shrinkage and associated changes in soil moisture.
